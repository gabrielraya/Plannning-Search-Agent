    "STRIPS is considered to be the first major planning system in the whole history of AI, as a member of the class of problem solvers its main function is to achieved a sucessful path to a given goal.  \"STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) was used in conjuction with robot research SRI\". **[\\[2\\]](#references)**.  It was invented by Fikes and Nilsson in 1971. \n",

    "The most remarkable impact that STRIPS had in the field of AI is the representation language it used to solve the search problems by that time, which served as the foundation for what we know now as PDDL (Problem Domain Description Language)- standard language for the International Planning Competition since 1998- introduced by Ghallab in 1998, as a computer-parsable, standarized syntax for representing planning problems. Therefore, it gave rise to what we know as *Classical Planning* and all its related concepts (Planning Graph, pattern databases for planning heuristics, GRAPHPLAN system, and many more).\n",

It differs from HSP in a number of important details\".**[\\[3\\]](#references)**\n",

    "Planning research has been central to AI since its inception, and papers on planning are a staple of mainstream AI journals and conferences. There are also specialized conferences such as the International Conference on AI Planning Systems, the International Workshop on Planning and Scheduling for Space, and the European Conference on Planning."
