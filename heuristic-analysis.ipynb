    "A **Planning Search Agent** to solve deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo Transport System was implemented for this project based on **Planing Graph** and **Automatic Domain-independent Heuristics with A\\* Search ** given three problems in the Air Cargo domain that use the same action schema.  An analysis of the results obtained is provided in this document based on the performace in terms of the number of node expansions required, number of goal tests, time elapsed, and optimality of solution.  Foward(progression) state-space search is compared using uniformed and informed algorithms. We will analyize the performance of several uninformed search algorithms—algorithms that are given no information about the problem other than its definition, although some of these algorithms can solve any solvable problem, none of them can do so efficiently. Finally we will also analyize the performance of Informed search algorithms, on the other hand, can do quite well given some guidance on where to look for solutions.\n",

PDDL describes the four things we need to define a search problem: the *initial state*, the *actions* that are available in a state, the *result* of applying an action, and the *goal test*. We will describe this concepts in specific for each problem.\n",

    "A Air cargo transport problem involves loading and unloading cargo and flying it from place to place. The problem can be defined with three actions: *Load, Unload,* and *Fly*. The actions affect two predicates: *In(c, p)* means that cargo *c* is inside plane *p*, and *At(x, a)* means that object *x* (either plane or cargo) is at airport *a*.  When a plane flies from one airport to another, all the cargo inside the plane goes with it. In first-order logic it would be easy to quantify over all objects that are inside the plane. But basic PDDL does not have a universal quantifier, so we need a different solution. The approach we use is to say that a piece of cargo ceases to be At anywhere when it is In a plane; the cargo only becomes At the new airport when it is unloaded. So At really means “available for use at a given location.”\n",

The reasoning is that \"Greedy best-first search tries to expand the node that is closest to the goal, on the grounds that this is likely to lead to a solution quickly. Thus, it evaluates nodes by using just the heuristic function; that is, f(n) = h(n).\" \"The worst-case time and space complexity for the tree version is <i>O(b</i><sup>m</sup>), where *m* is the maximum depth of the search space. With a good heuristic function, however, the complexity can be reduced substantially. The amount of the reduction depends on the particular problem and on the quality of the heuristic.**[\\[1\\]](#references)**.

Forward Search algorithms can take advantage of the representation PDDL uses throuhg accurate heuristics that can be derived automatically from the structure representation. A data structure called the **Planning Graph** was presented which can make the search for a plan more efficient, due to the its polynomial-size approximation of the exponential tree that represents all possible paths rather than just exponential time. \n",
