Uninformed planning search for air_cargo_p1, air_cargo_p2, and air_cargo_p3 planning problems are documented and analyzed based on the performace in terms of the number of node expansions required, number of goal tests, time elapsed, and optimality of solution.

    "For this problem Greedy Best First Graph Search (GBFGS + h1) performs the best by far, achieving the fastest speed with the lowest number of node expansions.\n",
    "The reasoning for this is, \"Greedy best-first search tries to expand the node that is closest to the goal, on the grounds that this is likely to lead to a solution quickly. Thus, it evaluates nodes by using just the heuristic function; that is, f(n) = h(n).\" **[\\[1\\]](#user-content-references)** In this small problem GBF finds the solution easily with minimal node expansion or time.\n",

    "For this problem even though GBFGS is still the fastest it doesn't find the most optimal solution. BFS is able to solve an optimal solution in only 6.5 times longer, because \"if the shallowest goal node is at some finite depth d, breadth-first search will eventually find it after generating all shallower nodes (provided the branching factor b is finite)\" **[\\[2\\]](#user-content-references)**\n",
    "\n",
    "However we can already see that the time and space complexity is becoming a problem for BFS. Turning to A\\* with the ignore heuristic we can solve the problem with an optimal solution and only 4.5 times the GBFGS run time and less than half the node expansion of BFS. Even though the problem appears to be only marginally more complex than the first, non optimal solutions can be drastically worse for cost, so if optimal step count is important certain algorithms such as DFGS should be ruled out.\n",
