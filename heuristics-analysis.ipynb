    "A Air cargo transport problem involves loading and unloading cargo and flying it from place to place. The problem can be defined with three actions: *Load, Unload,* and *Fly*. The actions affect two predicates: *In(c, p)* means that cargo *c* is inside plane *p*, and *At(x, a)* means that object *x* (either plane or cargo) is at airport *a*.  When a plane flies from one airport to another, all the cargo inside the plane goes with it. In first-order logic it would be easy to quantify over all objects that are inside the plane. But basic PDDL does not have a universal quantifier, so we need a different solution. The approach we use is to say that a piece of cargo ceases to be At anywhere when it is In a plane; the cargo only becomes At the new airport when it is unloaded. So At really means “available for use at a given location.”\n",

The reasoning is that \"Greedy best-first search tries to expand the node that is closest to the goal, on the grounds that this is likely to lead to a solution quickly. Thus, it evaluates nodes by using just the heuristic function; that is, f(n) = h(n).\" \"The worst-case time and space complexity for the tree version is <i>O(b</i><sup>m</sup>), where *m* is the maximum depth of the search space. With a good heuristic function, however, the complexity can be reduced substantially.

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "We have seen how **planning** --devising a plan of action to achieve one's goal-- is critical part of AI, as It allow us to scale up to problems that could not be handled by earlier aproaches like Uniformed Seach(bdf,dfs,etc). Forward Search algorithms can take advantage of the representation PDDL uses throuhg accurate heuristics that can be derived automatically form the structure representation. A data structure called the **Planning Graph** was presented which can make the search for a plan more efficient. Finally we conclude the section by compraring the various approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDDL was implemented to allow us to express all *n* actions with one action schema (like the load, unload, fly action schema), where **Actions** are described by a set of action schemas that implicitly define the `ACTIONS(S)` and `RESULT(s,a)` functions needed to do a problem-solving search.Classical planning concentrates on problems where most actions leave most things unchanged.PDDL does that by specifying the result of\n",
    "an action in terms of what changes; everything that stays the same is left unmentioned.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "We so how neither forward nor backward search is efficient without a good heuristic function. Recall from Chapter 3 that a heuristic function h(s) estimates the distance from a state s to the goal and that if we can derive an admissible heuristic for this distance—one that does not overestimate—then we can use A∗ search to find optimal solutions. An admissible heuristic can be derived by defining a relaxed problem that is easier to solve. The exact cost of a solution to this easier problem then becomes the heuristic for the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how Planning uses a factored representation for states and action schemas. That makes it possible to define good domain-independent heuristics and for programs to automatically apply a good domain-independent heuristic for a given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "We were given the initial state and the goal. Planning as search, search from intial state to goal, we use standard search techniques, including heuristic search.  We solve the problem first as a Progression planning problems with graph searches such as breadth-first, depth-first, and A*, where the nodes of the graph are \"states\" and edges are \"actions\". A \"state\" is the logical conjunction of all boolean ground \"fluents\", or state variables, that are possible for the problem using Propositional Logic. For example, we might have a problem to plan the transport of one cargo, C1, on a single available plane, P1, from one airport to another, SFO to JFK.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case scenario is 2k \n",
    "\n",
    "AlPlanning Graph was implemented to give better heuristic estimates.  \"These heuristics can be applied to any of the search techniques we have seen so far. Alternatively, we can search for a solution over the space formed by the planning graph,\n",
    "using an algorithm called GRAPHPLAN.(pag 379)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning graph is somewhat complex, but is useful in planning because it is a polynomial-size approximation of the exponential tree that represents all possible paths. The planning graph can be used to provide automated admissible heuristics for any domain. It can also be used as the first step in implementing GRAPHPLAN, a direct planning algorithm that you may wish to learn more about on your own (but we will not address it here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning graph can’t answer definitively whether G is reachable from S0, but it can estimate how many steps it takes to reach G. The estimate is always correct when it reports the goal is not reachable, and it never overestimates the number of steps, so it is an admissible heuristic.Despite the resulting increase in the size of the problem description, planning\n",
    "graphs have proved to be effective tools for solving hard planning problems.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However we can already see that the time and space complexity is becoming a problem for BFS. Turning to A\\* with the ignore heuristic we can solve the problem with an optimal solution and only 4.5 times the GBFGS run time and less than half the node expansion of BFS. Even though the problem appears to be only marginally more complex than the first, non optimal solutions can be drastically worse for cost, so if optimal step count is important certain algorithms such as DFGS should be ruled out.\n"
