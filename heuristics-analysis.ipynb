Even though the problem appears to be only marginally more complex than the first, non optimal solutions can be drastically worse for cost, so if optimal step count is important certain algorithms such as DFGS should be ruled out.\n",

    "We have seen how **planning** --devising a plan of action to achieve one's goal-- is critical part of AI, as It allow us to scale up to problems that could not be handled by earlier aproaches like Uniformed Seach(bdf,dfs,etc). Forward Search algorithms can take advantage of the representation PDDL uses throuhg accurate heuristics that can be derived automatically form the structure representation. A data structure called the **Planning Graph** was presented which can make the search for a plan more efficient. Finally we conclude the section by compraring the various approaches.\n",
