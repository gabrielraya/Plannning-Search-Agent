    "A **Planning Search Agent** to solve deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo Transport System was implemented for this project based on **Planing Graph** and **Automatic Domain-independent Heuristics with A\\* Search ** given three problems in the Air Cargo domain that use the same action schema.  An analysis of the results obtained is provided in this document based on the performace in terms of the number of node expansions required, number of goal tests, time elapsed, and optimality of solution.  Foward(progression) state-space search is compared using uniformed and informed algorithms. We will analyize the performance of several uninformed search algorithms—algorithms that are given no information about the problem other than its definition, although some of these algorithms can solve any solvable problem, none of them can do so efficiently. Finally we will also analyize the performance of Informed search algorithms, on the other hand, can do quite well given some guidance on where to look for solutions.\n",

    "## Intro To the Planning problems\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "A Air cargo transport problem involves loading and unloading cargo and flying it from place to place. The problem can be defined with three actions: *Load, Unload,* and *Fly*. The actions affect two predicates: *In(c, p)* means that cargo *c* is inside plane *p*, and *At(x, a)* means that object *x* (either plane or cargo) is at airport *a*.  When a plane flies from one airport to another, all the cargo inside the plane goes with it. In first-order logic it would be easy to quantify over all objects that are inside the plane. But basic PDDL does not have a universal quantifier, so we need a different solution. The approach we use is to say that a piece of cargo ceases to be At anywhere when it is In a plane; the cargo only becomes At the new airport when it is unloaded. So At really means “available for use at a given location.”\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "We have seen how **planning** --devising a plan of action to achieve one's goal-- is critical part of AI, as It allow us to scale up to problems that could not be handled by earlier aproaches like Uniformed Seach(bdf,dfs,etc). Forward Search algorithms can take advantage of the representation PDDL uses throuhg accurate heuristics that can be derived automatically form the structure representation. A data structure called the **Planning Graph** was presented which can make the search for a plan more efficient. Finally we conclude the section by compraring the various approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDDL was implemented to allow us to express all *n* actions with one action schema (like the load, unload, fly action schema), where **Actions** are described by a set of action schemas that implicitly define the `ACTIONS(S)` and `RESULT(s,a)` functions needed to do a problem-solving search.Classical planning concentrates on problems where most actions leave most things unchanged.PDDL does that by specifying the result of\n",
    "an action in terms of what changes; everything that stays the same is left unmentioned.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "We so how neither forward nor backward search is efficient without a good heuristic function. Recall from Chapter 3 that a heuristic function h(s) estimates the distance from a state s to the goal and that if we can derive an admissible heuristic for this distance—one that does not overestimate—then we can use A∗ search to find optimal solutions. An admissible heuristic can be derived by defining a relaxed problem that is easier to solve. The exact cost of a solution to this easier problem then becomes the heuristic for the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how Planning uses a factored representation for states and action schemas. That makes it possible to define good domain-independent heuristics and for programs to automatically apply a good domain-independent heuristic for a given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "We were given the initial state and the goal. Planning as search, search from intial state to goal, we use standard search techniques, including heuristic search.  We solve the problem first as a Progression planning problems with graph searches such as breadth-first, depth-first, and A*, where the nodes of the graph are \"states\" and edges are \"actions\". A \"state\" is the logical conjunction of all boolean ground \"fluents\", or state variables, that are possible for the problem using Propositional Logic. For example, we might have a problem to plan the transport of one cargo, C1, on a single available plane, P1, from one airport to another, SFO to JFK.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case scenario is 2k \n",
    "\n",
    "Planning Graph was implemented to give better heuristic estimates. \"These heuristics can be applied to any of the search techniques we have seen so far. Alternatively, we can search for a solution over the space formed by the planning graph,\n",

    "\n",
    "A planning problem asks if we can\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning graph is somewhat complex, but is useful in planning because it is a polynomial-size approximation of the exponential tree that represents all possible paths. The planning graph can be used to provide automated admissible heuristics for any domain. It can also be used as the first step in implementing GRAPHPLAN, a direct planning algorithm that you may wish to learn more about on your own (but we will not address it here).\n",
